sd_cl (Save Directory and Change to the Last directly)
=====

Useful functions to change directories for Bash/Zsh and GNU screen/tmux.

## Installation

Get `sd_cl` and set to where you like,
then, call it from your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` like

    source /path/to/sd_cl

:white_check_mark: current version requires [sentaku](https://github.com/rcmdnk/sentaku).

If you use Homebrew or cURL to insatll, sentaku will be installed automatically, too.

If you directly get the script, please install sentaku or use
[standalone version](https://github.com/rcmdnk/sd_cl/tree/standalone)
(standalone version could be obsolete).

### cURL

You can use an install script on the web like:

    $ curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/rcmdnk/sd_cl/install/install.sh| sh

This will install scripts to `/usr/etc`
and you may be asked root password.

If you want to install other directory, do like:

    $ curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/rcmdnk/sd_cl/install/install.sh|  prefix=~/usr/local/ sh

### Homebrew at OS X

On Mac, you can install scripts by [Homebrew](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew):

    $ brew tap rcmdnk/rcmdnkpac
    $ brew install sd_cl

If you have [brew file](https://github.com/rcmdnk/homebrew-file), add following lines to Brewfile:

    tap 'rcmdnk/rcmdnkpac'
    brew 'sd_cl'

then, do:

    $ brew file install

Or if you write like:

    tapall 'rcmdnk/rcmdnkpac'

and do `brew file install`, you will have all useful scripts in
[rcmdnkpac](https://github.com/rcmdnk/homebrew-rcmdnkpac).

This installs `sd_cl` to `${HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/etc` (default: `/usr/local/etc/`).

### Download

Or, simply download scripts and set where you like.

:warning: Install [sentaku](https://github.com/rcmdnk/sentaku), too.

## Usage

### Main functions: sd/cl

`sd_cl` will load new functions:

* `sd` (save dirctory)
* `cl` (change to the last directory)

`sd` saves current directory to the directory history file.

If you give a directory name, it saves the given directory.

`cl` is used to change the directory to saved directories.

If it is called w/o arguments, you will move to the last saved directory by `sd`.


It is useful if you are working with GNU screen or tmux.
You can easily move to other window's directory.

* `sd` at Window 1 (e.g. directory: `~/usr/etc`).
* `cl` at Window 2, then you are in `~/usr/etc` at Window 2, too.

### Options for cl
Options for `cl` are here:

    Usage: cl [-lcph] [-n <number> ] [<number>] [<directory>]
    If there are no arguments, you will move to the last saved directory by sd command.
    If you give any directory name, it searches for it in saved directories
    and cd to there if only one is found.
    If more than one directories are found, go to the selection mode.
  
    Arguments:
       -l          Show saved directories
       -c          Show saved directories and choose a directory
       -C          Clear directories
       <number>    Move to <number>-th last directory
       -n <number> Move to <number>-th last directory (obsolete)
       -N          No header for selection window
       -p          Move to pre-defiend dirctory in ~/.predefDir
       -w          Move to other window's (screen/tmux) dirctory in ~/.windowDir
       -b          Move back to moving histories
       -v          Move from current directory, like Vim
       -h          Print this HELP and quit

`-l`, `-c`, `-C` and `-n` (`<number>`) are used exclusively.

`-p` (pre-defined directory list), `-w` (window directory list),
or `-b` (moving history)
change the list file and can be used with other options.

e.x.) `cl -p 3` moves to the 3rd directory stored in pre-defined directory list.

### Saved directory list and cl selection mode example

If you work w/o `-p`, `-w` or `-b`, `cl` uses saved (by `sd`) directory list.

If you use `-c`, `cl` starts selection mode. See below demo.

> [sd_cl demo in asciinema](http://asciinema.org/a/6904)

In the selection mode, you can use:

* j: Select 1 down.
* [n]j: Select [n] below. e.g.: 11j: Select 11th below.
* k: Select 1 up.
* [n]k: Select [n] up.
* d: Delete selected directory.
* gg: Select 1st directory.
* G: Select the last directory.
* [n]gg/G: Select n-th directory.
* Enter: Go to selected directory and quit.
* q: Quit.

### Pre-defined directory list

If you use `-p`, it uses `pre-defined` directory list, which is not changed by `sd`.

In normal selection mode (i.e. `cl -c`), you can select and put the directory
to the `pre-defined` directory list (use `p` in the mode).

### Window directory list

If you are working in GNU screen or tmux, each window's directory is saved automatically.
You can change a directory to there by using `-w` option.

It shows `window_number` `pane_number` (always 0 for GNU screen) and directory.

You can select only with `window_number` or `window_number`+`pane_number`, too.

e.g.:

    $ cl -w 3

This command change the directory to the directory of Window 3.
If it has several panes, it chooses the directory of the first pane.

### Vim like file explorer

Option `-v` will give you the continuous selection mode to change the directory,
like vim file explorer.

### Tab completion

Tab completion is available both for Bash and Zsh.

    $ cl [Tab] # Completion with saved directory list.
    $ cl -p [Tab] # Completion with pre-defined directory list.
    $ cl -w [Tab] # Completion with window directory list.
    $ cl -b [Tab] # Completion with moving history.

If you give directory name to `cl`, you will just move to the directory like normal `cd`.

### Demonstration

Demonstration with Bash 4.3.42.

![completion](http://rcmdnk.github.io/images/post/20160218_sd_cl.gif)

* `sd`: Save current directory.
* `cl -l`: Show the list.
* `cl test<Tab>`: Completion with paths including `test`.
* `cl test<Tab><Enter>`: Enter selection mode with paths including `test`.
* `cl test2<Enter>`: Change directory to **/tmp/test/test2**, as it is an unique candidate for `test2`.
* `cl -C`: Clear the list.

### Bonus alias/functions

* bd (back to directory): alias for to `popd >/dev/null`
* cd : `cd` is wrapped with `popd`. Useful to use with `bd`.
* cdpwd : works as `cd -P .`, i.e. resolves symbolic links in the path.

## Options

Following options can be set before sourcing `sd_cl` in `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`.

    # Directory store file
    export LASTDIRFILE=${LASTDIRFILE:-$HOME/.lastDir}
    export PREDEFDIRFILE=${PREDEFDIRFILE:-$HOME/.predefDir}
    export WINDOWDIRFILE=${WINDOWDIRFILE:-$HOME/.windowDir}

    # Number of store directories
    export NLASTDIR=${NLASTDIR:-20}
    
    # post cd (overwrite cd (Bash) or chpwd (Zsh)
    export ISPOSTCD=${ISPOSTCD:-1}
    
    # COMPLETION
    export NOCOMPLETION=${NOCOMPLETION:-0}
    export NOCOMPINIT=${NOCOMPLETION:-0}
    
    # cd wrap to pushd/popd
    export ISCDWRAP=${ISCDWRAP:-1}

First three values set directory list files for `saved`, `pre-defined` and `window`.

You can set maximum number of saved directories by `NLASTDIR` (default 20).

If you set `ISPOSTCD` to 0, it doesn't save window's directory
in GNU screen or tmux.

If you set `NOCOMPLETION` to 1, completion will be disabled.

For Zsh user, if you already initialized completions with `compinit`,
please set `export NOCOMPINIT=1`.
Otherwise `sd_cl` execute:


    autoload -Uz compinit
    compinit

If you don't want to wrap `cd` with `pushd`, set `ISCDWRAP` to 0.


If you already have wrapper function for `cd` or the setting for `chpwd` at Zsh,
you should be better to set:

    export ISPOSTCD=0 # Don't do automatic save
    export ISCDWRAP=0 # Don't wrap for pushd

Otherwise `sd_cl` overwrites these functions.

If you want to have automatic save in GNU screen/tmux with your `cd`/`chpwd`,
first, set above ISPOSTCD and ISCDWRAP as 0 to disable to wrap in `sd_cl`,
then call `post_cd` in your `cd` function for Bash like:

    builtin cd "$@"
    local ret=$?
    if [ $ret -eq 0 ];then
      post_cd
    fi
    return $ret

or simply call `post_cd` in `chpwd` for Zsh case.

If you want to enable pushd wrap in your `cd` function,
replace your `builtin(command) cd` command with

    wrap_cd "$@"

i.e., if you want to enable both in Bash, you should replace above `builtin cd "$@"`
with `wrap_cd "$@"`.
